::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Recognise that they work with data
- Compare what tasks they peform on data and the tools they use

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What sort of data do you work with?
- What do you do with it?
- What tools do you use to help you?

## Don't think you work with data? Think again

### Task 1

This group task is an opportunity for you to think about the sort of data you have, what you do
with it, and what tools you use to do that.

- Start by getting into pairs.
- Brainstorm all the different sorts of data you work with (examples might include metadata,
  catalogue data, legacy data, data ouptut from DROID etc.)
- Your instructor will gather in these ideas and lead a discussion to establish that we are all
  talking about roughly the same thing when we talk about data
- Get into groups of 4-6.
- Discuss your own data, trying to answer questions including; How much data do you have? Where
  is it stored? Who has access to it? How is it formatted or stored? Can you move it about easily -
  in and out of systems? In particular think about the tools you use to help you manage your data as
  well as any problems you have with it.
- Each group then reports back on two problems they have with their data.
- The instructor will collate these on a whiteboard and facilitate a discussion about; a) how
  starting to think in terms of data is a good first step for what we will be learning, b) what it
  is we will be learning, and c) how what we will be learning will help us to solve some of the
  problems we are facing.

### Task 2

This follow-on task aims to guide learners in thinking about data as conceptually seperate from
the systems that produce, store, and preserve it. It offers an opportunity to think about how
data move through archival systems and the value of archival data outside of those systems.

- As a group, consider the types of data you discussed in the previous task and select one
  representative example.
- Using sticky notes, map the lifecycle of a data point from the moment of creation to its
  long-term home or to disposition (long term transfer, destruction, etc.)
- Discuss: How many people or organizations have been custodians of the data? How many systems
  has it moved through? Is there a relationship between the individual(s) creating the data and
  those who make preservation or disposition decisions? How does the lifecycle of the dataset impact
  documentation, metadata, or the data itself?
- Each group attaches their data lifecycle map to the whiteboard
- The instructor will lead a discussion about lifecycles of archival data and highlight the
  potential value of these data outside of the systems we typically associate with archival data.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- We all have data and it is not just enough to put it into a system and forget about it
